10th March Statement, 1978

Greetings to all Tibetans on this 19th anniversary of the Tenth March Uprising. On this occasion I also remember and pray for those who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of our people and our country.

Recently the Chinese have intensified their propaganda about the "unprecedented happiness in Tibet today" through radio broadcasts and pictorial magazines. It is very difficult for the few selected foreign visitors, who are taken on guided tours for a few days and have to listen to explanations through interpreters carefully chosen by the Chinese, to know and tell us the actual welfare and conditions of the Tibetan people. It is obvious to impartial observers that these reports which are artificial, biased, one-sided and unreliable, will not be accepted by people who are able to see both sides of the picture.

If the six million Tibetans in Tibet are really happy and prosperous as never before there is no reason for us to argue otherwise. If the Tibetans are really happy the Chinese should allow every interested foreigner to visit Tibet without restricting their movements or meetings with the Tibetan people. This would enable the visitors to really know the true conditions in Tibet. Furthermore, the Chinese should allow the Tibetans in Tibet to visit their parents and relatives now in exile. These Tibetans can then study the conditions of those of us in exile living in free countries. Similar opportunity should be given to the Tibetans in exile. Under such an arrangement we can be confident of knowing the true situation inside Tibet. This is morally right and practicable. Instead of doing this why are the Chinese indulging only in propaganda to woo the Tibetans in exile to return?

We must remember that nothing can be achieved if we lose courage. Every Tibetan should continue to be determined and dedicated to the goal that our nation, like other nations in this world, is governed by our own people.
